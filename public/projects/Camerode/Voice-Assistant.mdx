<Contributing>

How can contributing increase development efficiency?

Everyone has some kind of idea or task and different ways they would like a Voice Assistant to work. Combining all of those ideas together into one prominent open-source program that one can run or connect around the house or your location.

If it is just one person, i.e. myself, I would only have one take of a voice assistant, with more developers, and designers we can not only improve the program but make it more accessible.
