<Overview>

The end-goal is a one-stop-shop for utilities for developers. A combination of frequently used utilities that are easily accessible on any machine, anywhere, when you need them. 

For now, nothing is persisted and it will just be a dumb front-end, mainly consisting of formatters, converters, encoders/decoders etc. In the future we hope to expand into user accounts to be able to persist data for various utils (think notes, markdown, scratch pages).

Since we are very early on, there isn't much to learn yet, and just about everything will change. I'd like a bigger focus on testing, and have TDD drive this app. We're using vitest for unit tests and cypress for e2e testing. 

For now, basically just picking up an issue and implementing a utility is fine to get a good amount of concrete code started. Then patterns and architecture will solidify itself and we will introduce a more solid onboarding process.
