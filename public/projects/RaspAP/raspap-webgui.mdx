<Overview>

RaspAP is feature-rich wireless router software that just works on many popular Debian-based devices. Our popular Quick installer creates a known-good default configuration in minutes on all current Raspberry Pis models, and many other single board computers, with onboard wireless. All recent 64- and 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite distributions are fully supported, with beta support for Armbian, Debian and Ubuntu Server.
