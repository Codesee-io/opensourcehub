<Overview>

Data Version Control is a data versioning, ML workflow automation, and experiment management tool that takes advantage of the existing software engineering toolset you're already familiar with (Git, your IDE, CI/CD, etc.). DVC helps data science and machine learning teams manage large datasets, make projects reproducible, and better collaborate.

DVC is available for Visual Studio Code, any system terminal, and as a Python library.
