<Overview>

If you ever happen to design and develop any sort of software project, you realise what a great tool git is. Well, someone might say that you cannot build software without git, or another repository management tool. Thus, as a developer in one or another level you are at least familiar with git and you will not quit using it any time soon.

    So, we are about to use already familiar tools for our job.

As long as you have developed with a team of other developers, or even alone for a company/manager you realise that there should be something to track the progress, break the job in smaller tasks, keep track of ideas, document business logic and tie it with technical details.

For many organisations a kanban board, a todo list etc is the way to do it. Thus, jira and other tools like it, whether you like it or hate it, do a job that a lot of people are familiar with. Itâ€™s a way to organise the tasks at hand, and people are accustomed to use such variants.

    So, we are about to use already familiar notions and procedures.

The thought process here is to use the semantics of kanban tools (jira) with the help of git. An one man show or a team of 3, does not need another tool and another environment to keep track of a relatively small project and add some spicy bureaucracy on top of it.

At the same time, the need to track in an organised way the work done and to be done is considered vital. Especially if you jump around projects a lot and have to switch between contexts.

Well, this a markdown and a handful of git aliases.
Mostly I would like to see actual developers who would like to use it and get some feedback.
We will iterate the mental concepts rather than the actual code.

You are invited :)
