<Overview>

#### Streamdal is an open-source _'Code-Native Data Pipeline'_ solution for running data pipelines directly in your application code.

Streamdal equips you with a data observability graph and rule-based management tool to handle PII and help take action on data. It's built on several open-source components - an SDK, a server, and a console UI - designed to integrate seamlessly into your code.

All of the information on how to contribute can be found in our [contributing docs](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/resources-support/contributing/).

## Working on Streamdal

We leverage a lot of cutting-edge technology outside of what is available to scope by the tech focus here on Open Source Hub, namely stuff like:
- Protobuf
- gRPC
- Wasm (Streamdal uses Wasm to execute pipelines at near-native speeds - It's ridiculously fast)
- _And a lot of [open source!](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/resources-support/open-source/)_

Currently, we have support for `Go`, `Python`, and `Node`. But, we want to make Streamdal as available and extensible as possible.
<br />
We've listed many languages and relevant libraries we thought might be helpful to write SDKs and shims for in our docs. Take a look at them on the _"(TBA)"_ SDK pages and on the Libraries/Shims page: https://docs.streamdal.com/en/core-components/libraries-shims/
<br />
What we need is more input _(or maybe your expertise)_ to help make this happen!

We also offer real-time support through our discord ❤️ https://discord.gg/streamdal
