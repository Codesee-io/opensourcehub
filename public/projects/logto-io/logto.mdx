<Overview>

Logto helps you build the sign-in, auth, and user identity within minutes.

üßë‚Äçüíª A frontend-to-backend identity solution

- A delightful sign-in experience for end-users and an OIDC-based identity service.
- Web and native SDKs that can integrate your apps with Logto quickly.

üì¶ Out-of-box technology and UI support for many things you needed to code before

- A centralized place to customize the user interface and then LIVE PREVIEW the changes you make.
- Social sign-in for multiple platforms (GitHub, Google, WeChat, Alipay, etc.).
- Dynamic passcode sign-in (via SMS or email).

üíª Fully open-sourced, while no identity knowledge is required to use

- Super easy tryout (less than 1 min via GitPod, not joking), step-by-step tutorials and decent docs.
- A full-function web admin console to manage the users, identities, and other things you need within a few clicks.
