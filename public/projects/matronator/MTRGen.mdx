<Overview>

MTRGen is a file generator engine that can generate PHP files from JSON/YAML/NEON templates using a simple CLI utility. It enhances your JSON/YAML/NEON files with variables and filters, which can be either one of the built-in filters or any PHP function. With it you can create re-usable templates by adding variable <% placeholders %> anywhere in your file and have the content change dynamically based on the arguments you provide.
