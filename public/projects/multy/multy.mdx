<Overview>
# What is Multy?

**Multy** is an open-source tool that makes your infrastructure portable using a cloud-agnostic API. You write your cloud-agnostic configuration once and Multy deploys it to the clouds you choose.

Multy is available as a Terraform provider and can deploy to AWS, Azure, with GCP coming soon. The provider is also open-sourced at [multycloud/terraform-provider-multy](https://github.com/multycloud/terraform-provider-multy).

An example of an `object storage` deployment in Multy through Terraform:

```
resource "multy_object_storage" "obj_storage" {
  name       = "test-storage-123-multy"
  cloud      = "aws"
  location   = "us_east_1"
  versioning = true
}

resource "multy_object_storage_object" "public_obj_storage" {
  name              = "hello_world"
  object_storage_id = multy_object_storage.obj_storage.id
  content           = "<h1>hello world from ${each.key}</h1>"
  content_type      = "text/html"
  acl               = "public_read"
}
```

Changing clouds is as easy as changing the `cloud` parameter! With Multy, **you write once, and deploy anywhere**.
