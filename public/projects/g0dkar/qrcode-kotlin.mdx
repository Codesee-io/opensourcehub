<Overview>

This project aims to be a Backend-Friendly QRCode Generator built 100% in Kotlin. Easy to use, easy to extend, small and fast.

It was built after I had a lot of trouble with Google's ZXing library to simply generate a QRCode on a personal backend project. Besides being waaaaay too much of a library to simply create QRCodes, Google's ZXing library seems to be built with Maven and Android in mind, not anything else.

<Contributing>

Right now I'm looking for people that can help me with:

1. Improving the Aesthetics of the generated QRCodes
2. Improving the UX (DevEx/DevX/DX/whatever) of the API
3. Testing the project (especially performance)
