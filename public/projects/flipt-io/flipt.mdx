<Overview>

Flipt is an open-source, self-hosted feature flag application that allows you to run experiments across services in your environment.

Flipt can be deployed within your existing infrastructure so that you don't have to worry about your information being sent to a third party or the latency required to communicate across the internet.

Flipt supports use cases such as:

- Enabling trunk-based development workflows
- Testing new features internally during development before releasing them fully in production
- Ensuring overall system safety by guarding new releases with an emergency kill switch
- Gating certain features for different permission levels allowing you to control who sees what
- Enabling continuous configuration by changing values during runtime without additional deployments

## Code

It's always best to open a dialogue before investing a lot of time into a fix or new functionality.

Functionality must meet the design goals and vision for the project to be accepted; we would be happy to discuss how your idea can best fit into the future of Flipt.

Join our [Discord](https://www.flipt.io/discord) to chat with the team about any feature ideas or open a [Discussion](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/discussions) here on GitHub.

### Conventional Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages. Please adhere to this specification when contributing.

## Testing

New functionality must have accompanying tests. We aim to keep the total test coverage of the project above 80%.

## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes submitted to the Flipt project and assign the copyright of those changes to Flipt Software Inc.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR. Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours". 99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't scare you away from contributing.
