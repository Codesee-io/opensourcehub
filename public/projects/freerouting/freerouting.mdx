<Overview>

This software can be used together with all host PCB design software systems containing a standard Specctra or Electra DSN interface. It imports .DSN files generated by the Specctra interface of the host system and exports .SES Specctra session files.

Altough the software can be used for manual routing in 90 degree, 45 degree and free angle modes, it's main focus is on autorouting.
