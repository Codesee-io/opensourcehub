Exiv2 is a C++ Library for Image Metadata.  The project also supports the exiv2 command-line utility to read/write/modify/delete image metadata such as Exif, IPTC, XMP, ICC and image comments.  The project is maintained by a team of around 8 engineers who will welcome, encourage and mentor new members.  There is an extensive test harness written in Python.

The project is mature and was started in 2004. Today it's used by many applications, including the Gnome and KDE Desktops.  There is excellent documentation and web site.  The API documentations is generated by Doxygen.  https://exiv2.org
