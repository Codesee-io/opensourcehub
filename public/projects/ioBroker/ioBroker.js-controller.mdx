<Overview>

ioBroker is a cutting-edge platform for home automation that empowers you to take control of your smart home devices and systems. With ioBroker, you can easily integrate and manage a wide range of devices and technologies, including lighting, heating, security systems, and more, all from a central interface. The platform is open-source, highly customizable, and scalable, allowing you to adapt it to your specific needs and grow with your changing requirements.

With support for multiple protocols and the ability to add new adapters and plugins, ioBroker is the ultimate solution for smart home automation.

ioBroker is written in JavaScript and can run on various devices and operation systems that can execute node.js (min 1GB RAM required), like Raspberry Pi, Docker Containers, Linux, MacOS and Windows.

</Overview>

<Contributing>

ioBroker is highly modular platform. It has so called "Adapters" that can be interpreted as plugins. Every plugin is undependable and can be maintained or developed by everyone.

We are looking for GUI (React), backend (node.js) and technical writers (German, English) to maintain our huge amount of code (more than 530 adapters)
