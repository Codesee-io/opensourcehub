<Overview>

Taipy provides a simple syntax, accelerating the process of creating interactive and customizable multiple-page dashboards. Taipy generates highly interactive interfaces including charts and all sorts of widely used controls. 

Taipy is also used to develop the back-end of an application. It models dataflows and orchestrates pipelines. Each pipeline execution is referred to as a scenario. Scenarios are stored, recorded, and actionable, enabling what-if analysis or KPI comparison.   

Taipy greatly eases your web application deployment. It provides the most suitable cloud tool to host, deploy, and share your Taipy applications easily. In addition, this platform provides the ability to manage, store, and maintain the various states of your backend.
