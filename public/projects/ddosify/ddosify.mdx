<Overview>

Ddosify is a high-performance load testing solution written in Golang. The mission of the Ddosify project is to create a generic and the most powerful load testing experience for developers.

These are the features of Ddosify OSS:

ðŸ“Œ Protocol Agnostic - Currently supporting HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2. Other protocols are on the way.
ðŸ“Œ Scenario-Based - Create your flow in a JSON file. Without a line of code!
ðŸ“Œ Different Load Types - Test your system's limits across different load types.
ðŸ“Œ Parameterization - Use dynamic variables just like on Postman.

For distributed, no-code and geo-targeted load testing, you can use Ddosify Cloud - https://ddosify.com
