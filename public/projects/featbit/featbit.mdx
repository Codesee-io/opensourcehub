<Overview>

Feature flag is a modern engineering technology that decouples code deployments from feature releases, giving you control over who sees each feature and when they see it.

FeatBit provides a holistic framework for managing feature flags that enables teams to use flags on a massive scale across various use cases, such as:

- Shipping software safer and faster by rolling out features progressively to target users without redeployment.
- Measuring the impact of featuresâ€™ rollouts and running A/B tests to improve feature quality.
- Giving Sales, CS, and Marketing the ability to fine-tune target audiences and manage customer entitlement.
etc.
