<Overview>

Wasp (Web Application Specification Language) is a declarative DSL (domain-specific language) for developing, building and deploying modern full-stack web apps with less code.

Concepts such as app, page, user, login, frontend, production, etc. are baked into the language, bringing a new level of expressiveness and allowing you to get more work done with fewer lines of code.

While describing high-level features with Wasp, you still write the rest of your logic in your favorite technologies (currently React, NodeJS, Prisma).
