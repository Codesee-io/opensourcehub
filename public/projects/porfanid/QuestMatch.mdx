<Overview>

The QuestMatch is an app that will be used to connect people together in DND campaigns. People will match based on their interests on DND and groups will be created.

In this way the people that are in a group will be able to connect and plan their DND campaign online.

People will register for an account and they will input their character sheet info or the option to be a DM.
The app will then recognize the characters and match the groups together forming team. Once the DM has finalized the groups, a group chat will be created informing all members that they have been added to the group.
