<Overview>

Pocketenv is designed to streamline the process of creating development environments within containers. It achieves this by utilizing template repositories containing Terraform code. By leveraging Terraform, Pocketenv offers a standardized and reproducible method for setting up development environments, ensuring consistency across different projects and teams.

# Key Features:

<b>CLI Interface</b>: Pocketenv provides a command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction, allowing users to quickly create and manage development environments.

<b>Containerization</b>: It utilizes containers to isolate and encapsulate development environments, ensuring consistency and portability across different systems.

<b>Template Repositories</b>: Pocketenv relies on template repositories containing Terraform code. These templates serve as blueprints for creating development environments, providing a standardized starting point.

<b>Reproducibility</b>: By using Terraform, Pocketenv enables the reproducible creation of development environments. This ensures that environments can be easily recreated or modified as needed, reducing configuration drift and potential inconsistencies.

<b>Flexibility</b>: Pocketenv offers flexibility in customizing development environments to suit specific project requirements. Users can modify and extend the provided templates to accommodate various configurations and setups.

<b>Developer Productivity</b>: With its streamlined workflow, Pocketenv aims to enhance developer productivity by reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage development environments.
