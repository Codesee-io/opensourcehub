<Overview>

stdlib is a standard library for JavaScript with a focus on numerical and scientific computing applications.

The easiest  analogy is that stdlib is NumPy/SciPy, but for JavaScript and for use in web applications. The project provides foundational data structures and numerical algorithms for scientific computing with an emphasis on performance, robustness, and clarity.
