<Overview>

ancv takes in a resume (aka CV) in JSON Resume format and converts it to ANSI-based text, fit for pretty-printed terminal output. Users can then, for example, `curl` an endpoint and receive your pretty-printed resume in their terminal! This is like a very nerdy, and terribly useless, "business card".

<Contributing>

Users can create new themes (think style sheets), templates (think HTML) and translations.
