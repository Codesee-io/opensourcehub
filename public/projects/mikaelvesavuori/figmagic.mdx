<Overview>

Figmagic is the missing piece between DevOps and design: Generate design tokens, export graphics, and extract design token-driven React components from your Figma documents.

Figmagic automates the world into a better place, but does not attempt to completely remove designers or developers: It just aims to move them closer, while eliminating most of the tedious busywork that has grown around front-end development.
