<Overview>

This tool allows you to let commands wait for something else to complete before continuing. Whether it's for a web service to become available to maybe a port to open. You can add some simple orchestration to the command line.

Take a look at the open issues or just open a PR. If you follow the template when you create it, it make my life as a maintainer MUCH easier. If you have an idea for what you think the tool needs then just create an issue using the correct template. If you're just not sure, then raise an issue to start the discussion anyway.
