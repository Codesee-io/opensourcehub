## How to list your own project

1. Follow the setup steps in the [README](https://github.com/Codesee-io/opensourcehub#readme)
1. Take a peek inside the `/public/projects` directory for examples of existing repo
1. Create a new folder inside `/public/projects` and name it the same as your GitHub organization
1. Add a new `.mdx` file using the name of your repo
1. Copy/paste the contents of `/public/projects/_template.mdx` into that file
1. Fill out the information. Note that most of it is optional, but extremely helpful for potential contributors.
1. Preview your changes locally.
1. When you're ready, open a PR!
