<Overview>

Ockam is a suite of open source programming libraries and command line tools to orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key management, credential management, and authorization policy enforcement – at massive scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. To trust data-in-motion, applications need end-to-end guarantees of data authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. To be private and secure by-design, applications must have granular control over every trust and access decision. Ockam allows you to add these controls and guarantees to any application.
