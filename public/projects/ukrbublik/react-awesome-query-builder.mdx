*For tech writers:*
Any help with improving docs is much appreciated. 
My native language is not English, so tech docs for the library need to be improved and be easier to read and understand.
Also, adding Storybook to the lib would be sweet.


*For developers:*
Use `pnpm i && pnpm start` to start the demo project locally with hot-reload and play with the code in `/examples` `/core` `/ui` packages folders.
There are a lot of features users request and you can implement them.
