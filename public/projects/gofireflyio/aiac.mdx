<Overview>

aiac is a command line tool to generate IaC (Infrastructure as Code) templates, configurations, utilities, queries and more via OpenAI's API. The CLI allows you to ask the model to generate templates for different scenarios (e.g. "get terraform for AWS EC2"). It will make the request, and store the resulting code to a file, or simply print it to standard output.

If youâ€™re interested in running AIAC locally and learning about how it works, please see our Instructions Guide. It includes helpful instructions for AIAC usage, development and debugging.
We have two main channels for supporting AIaC:
1. Slack community: general user support and engagement.
2. GitHub Issues: bug reports and enhancement requests.
