<Overview>

We design a new language that is aiming at replacing SQL for analytical queries. The main focus if compiler development, but we are also providing bindings (libraries) for many languages and plugins for IDE or data tools.

</Overview>

<Contributing>

We are looking compiler developers (Rust) and designers/website developers to boost our presentation of the language.
