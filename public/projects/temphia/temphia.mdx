<Overview>

Temphia is a platform for small apps, known as "plugs", which run inside a language virtual machine (VM) such as JavaScript (JS) or WebAssembly (Wasm), and communicate with each other through message passing. Apps have specific capabilities based on the resources they are assigned.

Code in frontend lives in code/frontend folder, unlike project of similar which tend to have multiple files managed by pnpm/yarn workspace or whatever people have invented today, instead every entry (that generates .js file out after compilation) lives in entries directory. and has corresponding build command is found in package.json. most of those entries are svelte project so package json build pass own config/entry file as env variable. if it is not svelte entry then it is probably compiled by ncc which generates concated self contained js file which is perfect for libs.

When entry gets built, its output is in public/build folder there is a copy_files script that is responsible for copying to backend/data/assets/build so it could be included in static binary using golangs embed package. When you are developing go dev cli serves files directly from public/build but in not dev mode it fallbacks to that embed package files. so if you forgot to run copy files from time to time when you modify frontend code then non dev server might run in old build file then you build with in dev.
