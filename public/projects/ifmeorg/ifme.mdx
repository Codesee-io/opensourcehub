<Overview>

if-me.org is a community for mental health experiences that encourages people to share their personal stories with trusted allies. Trusted allies are the people we interact with on a daily basis, including friends, family members, co-workers, teachers, and mental health workers.

We care about marginalized communities that have little or no access to mental health education, resources, and services - including refugee and immigrant communities and communities of colour.

We truly believe mental health needs to be open in order to improve lives. Mental health education, resources, and services need to be accessible to as many communities as possible.
