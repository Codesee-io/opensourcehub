<Overview>

Million is an extremely fast and lightweight (<4kb) virtual DOM that makes React components up to 70% faster. 
You gain big performance wins for UI and data-heavy React apps giving you faster rendering and loading speeds. Million.js is easy to use; all you have to do is wrap your React component with just a block().
