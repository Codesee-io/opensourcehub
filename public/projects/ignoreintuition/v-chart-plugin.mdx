<Overview>

This plugin is designed to allow Vue.js developers to incorporate fully reactive and customizable charts into their applications. The plugin is built off of the D3.js JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. By binding data from your components, you can create complex charts and graphs that respond to changes in your application. Vue.js lifecycle events will trigger the charts to update and maintain two-way binding between your charts and your data. By adding in a state management (such as Vuex) you can additionally persist state across an entire application.

V Chart Plugin is built using Vue.js' component architecture. This will allow the chart to be a first class citizen of your Vue.js application. Combining multiple charts allows you to create complex dashboards and enable deeper insights into your data. All aspects of the charts can be configured to allow for full customization of your graphs along with the ability to style the SVG elements using the classes and IDs generated for each individual canvas element.
