<Overview>

FastTrackML is an open source collaboration designed to build a bridge to a better MLOps-enabled future:
- It has scalability, broad ecosystem support, usability and real-time metrics that can be tailored to your specific needs
- It combines the benefits of the open source ecosystem around MLflow and the flexible analysis tools of Aim’s user interface (UI) with G-Research’s deep experience in operating large, complex ML workflows
- It will help you explore your experiment data quickly – possibly as much as 100 times faster than existing solutions – with the flexibility and customisation options that make the most sense for you
