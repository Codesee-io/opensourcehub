# DA Landing Site 2.0

Distribute Aid's landing site, where we get to tell the world who the heck we are and what the hell we're doing!

The main goals of this project are to:

1. Create a landing site that introduces Distribute Aid, highlights our projects & services, publicly documents our impact, communicates upcoming plans to our network, highlights how to join / support us, and of course credits the many people who have contributed over the years.
2. Make it easy for any Distribute Aid volunteer to manage content and publish changes to the site directly. This includes all text & images, but also data that powers components, pages & site structure, and some site metadata.
3. Provide engaging pathways for design & dev volunteers to directly collaborate with the rest of the team, without holding them back.  Our whole team will be contributing well structured content, which helps clarify what's needed without a ton of meetings.  Use your favorite tools to make it shine.
